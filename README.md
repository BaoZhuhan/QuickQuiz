QuickQuiz is a minimal, elegant, and reliable Single Page Application (SPA) quiz system designed for efficient practice across multiple subjects and question sets. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a glassmorphism UI inspired by Apple's design language, supporting multiple question types including single-choice, multiple-choice, and true/false. By prioritizing data integrity and seamless interaction—such as auto-advancing on correct answers and subject-scoped randomization—QuickQuiz provides a pure, distraction-free environment for users to master their knowledge with ease.

## Key Features
- **Pure Frontend Implementation**: No build tools, zero dependencies, and lightning-fast performance.
- **Subject-Oriented Organization**: Seamlessly manage questions categorized by Subjects and Question Sets.
- **Optimized UX**: Single-choice questions submit instantly on selection with automatic progression for correct answers.
- **Stunning Visuals**: Sleek glassmorphism design with support for Light, Dark, and several Pastel color themes.
- **Data Resilience**: Built-in data normalization logic to handle and recover from non-standard JSON formats.
